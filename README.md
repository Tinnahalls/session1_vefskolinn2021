# Vefskolinn 2021 - SCSS
This site is the first project for Vefskolinn to practice getting acquainted with the tools we will be using in this course and learn a bit of HTML and CSS.
Now it has been updated with SCSS

# SCSS
This project uses SASS, it uses watch sass to compile the scss to a css file. 
I used @import thought I am a aware @use and @forward will be the thing moving forward. 

# Please read the comment
Please read the comment in the code to see the work done. The site is not optimally design,  this is just to show what I have learned.
