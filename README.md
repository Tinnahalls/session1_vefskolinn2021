# Session 1 for Vefskolinn 2021
This site is the first project for Vefskolinn to practice getting acquainted with the tools we will be using in this course and learn a bit of HTML and CSS. 

# What is HTML and CSS?

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item.
⋅⋅* Understand what a markup language is.
⋅⋅* Understand what a style sheet language is.
⋅⋅* Understand what the "cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets means.
⋅⋅* Understand what "static site hosting" is.


1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
